# Agent Notes

## Work Completed
- Normalized `config.yaml` (alert thresholds, logging, cleaned duplicates) and
  hardened loader validation.
- Refactored the GUI for thread-safe updates, resource history charts, alert
  banner, and Windows log access button.
- Implemented CSV-based resource logging, alert cooldown handling, and GPU/CPU
  threshold notifications in the monitor thread.
- Stabilized the video processor with thread control, ETA handling, and ensured
  OCR/LLM integrations respect configuration.
- Added EasyOCR/Tesseract caching, preprocessing, and graceful fallbacks.
- Hardened the LLM layer with lazy loading and thread-safe pipeline access.
- Expanded the README with comprehensive Windows usage, configuration, and
  troubleshooting guidance.

## Partially Complete
- Resource analytics beyond CSV export (graph exports, advanced insights).
- Comprehensive error handling around OCR/LLM exceptions for user feedback.
- Automated test coverage for the processing and monitoring modules.

## Next Steps
1. Add advanced analytics (trend summaries, alert history exports).
2. Improve multilingual OCR accuracy and expose per-language preprocessing
   controls.
3. Implement automated tests for config loading, monitoring, and video
   processing.
4. Extend GUI customization with layout presets and widget scaling options.
