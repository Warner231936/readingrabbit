# Agent Notes

## Work Completed
- Extended `config.yaml` and loader to cover analytics paths, logging, layout
  presets, scaling, and language-aware OCR preprocessing helpers.
- Rebuilt the GUI with stack/compact presets, DPI scaling, summary banner, and
  quick-open buttons for logs, summaries, and alert history.
- Upgraded the resource monitor with JSON analytics, alert history export,
  trend calculations, and structured logging.
- Hardened OCR/LLM layers with configurable preprocessing, graceful fallbacks,
  and centralized logging.
- Enhanced the video processor with robust error handling, logging, and the new
  preprocessing pipeline integration.
- Added a dedicated logging helper, refreshed documentation, and expanded the
  Windows-focused usage notes.
- Delivered automated pytest coverage for config loading, resource analytics,
  and video processing behaviour.

## Partially Complete
- Optional future idea: provide visual chart exports for analytics summaries.

## Next Steps
1. (Optional) Ship graphical exports for analytics summaries if stakeholders
   request them.
2. Monitor upstream dependencies for updates to OCR/LLM packages.
